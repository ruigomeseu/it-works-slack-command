A Slack command that accepts a string as input and responds with a message that will be posted to all members of the Slack channel.

## Example

### Input

/itworks string

### Output
S T R I N G<br>
T<br>
R<br>
I<br>
N<br>
G<br>

## Why?

Mostly because I had some spare time and I wanted to mess with Node, OpenShift and Slack commands. This is the implementation of a [meme](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/vertical-posting) that's commonly posted on some subreddits I read.
